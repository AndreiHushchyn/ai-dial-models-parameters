The water cycle is how water moves around the Earth in a big circle. Here's how it works:

1. **Evaporation**: The sun warms up water in rivers, lakes, or oceans, turning it into vapor (like steam) that goes into the air.
2. **Condensation**: The vapor cools down high in the sky, turning into tiny water droplets that make clouds.
3. **Precipitation**: When clouds get heavy, the water falls back to Earth as rain, snow, or hail.
4. **Collection**: The water collects again in rivers, lakes, and oceans, ready to start the cycle over.

It happens over and over, helping keep water on Earth clean and moving!
