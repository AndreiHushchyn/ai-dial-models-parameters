================================================== RESPONSE ==================================================
In the context of Large Language Models (LLMs), **entropy** measures the uncertainty or randomness in their responses. It quantifies how evenly the model's probability distribution is spread over possible next tokens during text generation.

- **Low entropy:** The model focuses on a few high-probability tokens, leading to repetitive and predictable responses.
- **High entropy:** The model considers many token options with similar probabilities, resulting in varied and less structured outputs.

Entropy control can be adjusted using settings like **temperature**, which influences the randomness of the output by modifying the token sampling process. Lower temperature reduces entropy for deterministic answers, while higher temperature increases it for creative or diverse responses.
