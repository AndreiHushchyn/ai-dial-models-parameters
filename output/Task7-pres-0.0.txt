================================================== RESPONSE ==================================================
In the context of Large Language Model (LLM) responses, **entropy** refers to the measure of randomness or unpredictability in the model's output. It is often used to assess how "diverse" or "confident" the generated responses are.

- **High entropy** means the model is generating responses with greater randomness, potentially resulting in more creative or varied outputs, but with less certainty.
- **Low entropy** indicates more predictable and deterministic responses, which may be safer but less diverse.

Entropy is typically controlled during text decoding processes, such as sampling methods (e.g., temperature-based sampling or nucleus sampling). It balances creativity and coherence in generating responses.
