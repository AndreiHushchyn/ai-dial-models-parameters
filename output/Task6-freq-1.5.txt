The water cycle is how water moves around the Earth. It has four main steps:

1. **Evaporation**: The sun heats up water in rivers, lakes, and oceans, turning it into vapor (like steam) that rises into the air.

2. **Condensation**: As the vapor cools down high in the sky, it turns back into tiny drops of water and forms clouds.

3. **Precipitation**: When lots of drops come together and get heavy, they fall from the clouds as rain or snow.

4. **Collection**: The rain or snow flows back to rivers, lakes, or oceans—and then starts all over again!

It's a never-ending circle!
