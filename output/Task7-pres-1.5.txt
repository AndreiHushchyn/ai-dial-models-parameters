================================================== RESPONSE ==================================================
In the context of large language models (LLMs), entropy refers to a measure of uncertainty or randomness in the model's responses. It quantifies how much variation exists in the output probabilities for the next token prediction. Higher entropy indicates more uncertainty and a broader range of possible outputs, while lower entropy reflects greater confidence in specific predictions.

Adjusting the entropy, often through parameters like *temperature*, can influence how creative or deterministic the model's responses are—lower temperatures reduce entropy for more focused answers, while higher temperatures increase entropy, enabling more diverse and exploratory responses.
